'@backstage/connections': patch
---

Added a `title` field to connections, providing a human-readable display name for each connection. When not explicitly configured, the title defaults to the provider name (e.g. "GitHub") or includes the host when multiple connections share a type (e.g. "GitHub (ghe.acme.com)").
